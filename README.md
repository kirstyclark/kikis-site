# Kiki's Site

### Ongoing personal project presenting my radio and sound works created using React.

Kiki's Site includes an archive of all my radio work and 'Top Twenty' lists.

Click on a radio show card, and a Mixcloud popup player will arrive at the bottom of your screen. 
Enjoy perusing the rest of my website while the sweet sounds continue unaffected!

The site has a range of themes such as 'forest', 'pinky' and 'deep blue', as well as the 'classic' steel and orange.

Make sure to check the site regularly to see the week's updated 'Top Twenty' list and the daily updated 'Mystery of the day'!
